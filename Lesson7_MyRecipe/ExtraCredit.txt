In this extra credit portion of the assignment, I:

-added a DOM traversal: display 2 (Ingredients and Instructions) is toggled very quickly. 

-added a CSS change: line 49 and 50 create a 100px space between h2 and h3.  

-added an animation/event: line 46 and 47 use ".append" to add "ENJOY!!" at the end of the instructions.
